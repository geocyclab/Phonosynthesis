# Phonosynthesis
In this terrarium coexist a set of undergrowth plants with a capture device developed to analyze the process of photosynthesis. The system consists of eight sensors (CO2 - O2 - internal hygrometry - external hygrometry - soil moisture - internal temperature - external temperature - brightness). These sensors produce real-time data that is analyzed, processed, and sent to an open source virtual synthesizer made with Puredata.
